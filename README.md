#C212 Final Project - Trails
##What is Trails?
Trails is a 2 player game played on a board of hexagonal tiles. It can technically be whatever size you want it to be, but I have 3x3 as the set minimum size and 99x99 as the set maximum.


##Why Trails?
Trails was the final project for an introduction to software design class at my university. The goal of this project was to get the students used to working on larger projects, and object oriented programming.


##Things I learned

This by far the biggest project that I have worked on. It was a great learning experience and tested my abilities. It forced me to think of the big picture of the project, and research topics that I had no previous knowledge of such as GUIs, Artificial Intelligence, and Threads. This class and project really helped with learning java and computer science concepts.


##Improvements

JLabel that tells you who won, AI that can beat a human, etc.
